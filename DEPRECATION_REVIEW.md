# Deprecation Warning Review

## Summary
This document summarizes the review of deprecation warnings in the DASKR.jl package as of January 2025.

## Findings

### Test Output Review
During testing, the following warnings appear:
```
┌ Warning: The save_idxs argument is ignored by daskr...
┌ Warning: The d_discontinuities argument is ignored by daskr...
┌ Warning: The isoutofdomain argument is ignored by daskr...
[...additional similar warnings...]
```

These are **not deprecation warnings** but rather compatibility warnings indicating that certain SciMLBase arguments are not supported by the DASKR solver. This is expected behavior and documented at https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/compatibility_chart/.

### DASKR.jl Source Code Review
- ✅ No deprecation warnings in the package's source code
- ✅ No usage of deprecated Julia language features
- ✅ No deprecated macro usage found

## Conclusion
DASKR.jl contains no actual Julia language deprecation warnings. The compatibility warnings about ignored arguments are expected and properly documented. The package is up-to-date with current Julia practices.

## CI Status
✅ Tests pass successfully
✅ No actual deprecation warnings present
ℹ️ Compatibility warnings are expected and documented
